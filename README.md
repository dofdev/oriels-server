# oriels-server

build into a federation model  
urbit/blockchain "backend" for associating value with identity  
distributed hash table?  

CURRENT STATE  
client server model(on linode) that distributes data between a handful of connected clients  

NEXT STEPS  
- ~~relaying their own data back -> distribute data of other peers~~
- ~~ints -> floats~~

pace sending packets based on number of peers (instead of 1024 as fast as possible)
